<h1>My Profile</h1>
<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<p>My name is Isaac Ambrosio I’m 24 year old. My student number is s3756394, my RMIT email address is s3756394@student.rmit.edu.au.
I’m Peruvian by birth and I got a pretty fluent Spanish. I play a lot of online games and also do a lot of physical activities such as soccer 
and hitting the gym every now and then. An interesting fact would be a time when I got concussed while I was in a soccer match, it was a rainy day
and I went against the post head first. I felt how my soul left my body and came back haha (I’m not joking) it was scary.</p>

<h2>My interest in IT</h2>
<p>My main interest in IT is programming and the analytical part of it. I’m currently a Business Analyst Support half of the time at work creating reports, 
assessing and creating work instructions, providing results that helps us with the forecasting and the Annual Operating Plan and reviewing and validating data. 
The other half of the time I do a lot of admin work and ad hoc stuff.</p>

<p>I’ve always been fascinated with IT since I was just a child. It all started when I got my first pc. I’ve always liked to explore everything, see it 
and understand how it works from end to end, and well, during the process, I’m pretty sure some of us had the System32 folder deleted at some point 
to create more space in our SSD and install a pretty large game or application. I knew deep inside me that the machine wouldn’t be able to run it but I did it anyway. 
That’s when the person that sparked my interest in IT made his appearance.</p>

<p>The person that got me hooked was a Service desk Technician, he is my dad’s friend. His name is Milton. I remember him coming in one day with all his fancy tools, CDs and USBs. 
I couldn’t believe my eyes when he started working and restoring all my data with such an ease. I was amazed! And that’s when I knew what I wanted to do for a living. 
I learned a couple of thing from him by watching him and asking him questions. Sometimes I even had something broken on purpose just so I could watch him fix it.
As I mentioned before I’ve been exposed to IT since a young age and I still do at work and my everyday life, well, all of us do and we don’t even realize it. IT is everywhere.</p>

<p>I chose to study with RMTI because the scheduled and study periods accommodated pretty well to my work hours and other commitments. It was exactly what I was looking for. 
I also like how interactive it can be despite being an online course.
Now days is scary how technology has advanced in such a short period of time that even some of wouldn’t be able to live without it. 
This has pushed me to take the next step and get more into it. I expect have a really strong base and understand it pretty well which it will help me improve my skills and also come up with new ideas.</p>

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>

<p>As I mentioned before I have been working as a Business Analyst for a while but what I really enjoyed the most of that role was the programming part 
and understanding the needs for the Subject matter experts in order to create a better process for them to become more efficient and accurate and if you look at what 
a software developer do the first bullet point says that they typically analyse the users’ needs and then design, test and develop a software to meet those needs. 
If anyone wants to become a software developer they would need at least a bachelor’s degree in computer science, software engineering or a related field.</p>

<p>Here’s some important qualities that a software developer must have:</p>
<p>•	Analytical skills: Developers must analyse users’ needs and then design software to meet those needs.</p>
<p>•	Communication skills: Developers must be able to give clear instructions to others specially when working on a project. They must also explain to their customers 
how the software works and answer any questions that may have.</p>
<p>•	Creativity: Developers are the creative minds behind new computer software so this is an important skill as well.</p>
<p>•	Detail oriented: Developers often work on many parts of an application or system at the same time and must therefore be able to concentrate and pay attention to detail.</p>
<p>•	Interpersonal skills: Software developers must be able to work well with others who contribute to designing, developing, and programming successful software.</p>
<p>•	Problem-solving skills: Because developers are in charge of software from beginning to end, they must be able to solve problems that arise throughout the design process.</p>

<p> Currently, I haven’t set my eyes on a specific role but I’m constantly looking for any opportunities to use apply the new skills I have and I will acquire.</p>

<h2>Personal Profile</h2>

<p>Here’s the results of my personality tests:</p>
<h3> Myers-Briggs Type indicator </h3>

<p>I have got a protagonist personality or ENFJ as a result of my test. Everything you do right now ripples</p> 
<p>outward and affects everyone. Your posture can shine your heart or transmit anxiety. Your breath can</p> 
<p>radiate love or muddy the room in depression. Your glance can awaken joy. Your words can inspire</p>
<p>freedom. Your every act can open hearts and minds.</p>

<p>Some of the strengths are:</p>

<p>•	Tolerant </p>
<p>•	Reliable </p>
<p>•	Altruistic </p>
<p>•	Natural leaders </p>

<p>Here's some of the weaknesses: </p>

<p>•	Overly idealistic</p>

<h3>Big Five Personality test</h3>

<p>Having a high score on extroversion makes it easier for me to be more outgoing and social allowing me to </p>
<p>engage more with my teammates. Despite having a high score on Neuroticism, I find myself being positive</p>
<p>person and full of energy boing the one that get everyone together and making it comfortable for them </p>
<p>to approach me which is tied to my 3rd factor which makes me someone friendly and optimistic. I got a </p>
<p>low score on conscientiousness which makes me someone impulsive and disorganized. I got a high score</p>
<p>on imagination which also makes me flexible open to new experiences and ideas.</p>

<h3>Learning Style test</h3>

<p>I have obtained a visual/Tactile learner as a result from the test which means that understand and </p>
<p>remember things by sight which can be useful for my team for certain tasks. Also being a tactile learner </p>
<p>means that it’s easier for me to learn by doing and by being there in the moment. If there’s one thing that </p>
<p>I can completely agree with the result is that I need to be frequently active making it hard to sit still which</p>
<p>gives my team an opportunity to use that energy and convert it into actions.</p>
