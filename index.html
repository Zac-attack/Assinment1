<h1>My Profile</h1>
<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<p>My name Isaac Ambrosio I’m 24 year old. My student number is s3756394, my RMIT email address is s3756394@student.rmit.edu.au. I’m Peruvian by birth and I got a pretty fluent Spanish. I play a lot of online games and also do a lot of physical activities such as soccer and hitting the gym every now and then. An interesting fact would be a time when I got concussed while I was in a soccer match, it was a rainy day and I went against the post head first. I felt how my soul left my body and came back haha (I’m not joking) it was scary.</p>

<h2>My interest in IT</h2>
<p>My main interest in IT is programming and the analytical part of it. I’m currently a Business Analyst Support half of the time at work creating reports, assessing and creating work instructions, providing results that helps us with the forecasting and the Annual Operating Plan and reviewing and validating data. The other half of the time I do a lot of admin work and ad hoc stuff.</p>

<p>I’ve always been fascinated with IT since I was just a child. It all started when I got my first pc. I’ve always liked to explore everything, see it and understand how it works from end to end, and well, during the process, I’m pretty sure some of us had the System32 folder deleted at some point to create more space in our SSD and install a pretty large game or application. I knew deep inside me that the machine wouldn’t be able to run it but I did it anyway. That’s when the person that sparked my interest in IT made his appearance.</p>

<p>The person that got me hooked was a Service desk Technician, he is my dad’s friend. His name is Milton. I remember him coming in one day with all his fancy tools, CDs and USBs. I couldn’t believe my eyes when he started working and restoring all my data with such an ease. I was amazed! And that’s when I knew what I wanted to do for a living. I learned a couple of thing from him by watching him and asking him questions. Sometimes I even had something broken on purpose just so I could watch him fix it.
As I mentioned before I’ve been exposed to IT since a young age and I still do at work and my everyday life, well, all of us do and we don’t even realize it. IT is everywhere.</p>

<p>I chose to study with RMTI because the scheduled and study periods accommodated pretty well to my work hours and other commitments. It was exactly what I was looking for. I also like how interactive it can be despite being an online course.
Now days is scary how technology has advanced in such a short period of time that even some of wouldn’t be able to live without it. This has pushed me to take the next step and get more into it. I expect have a really strong base and understand it pretty well which it will help me improve my skills and also come up with new ideas.</p>

<h1>Ideal Job</h1>

<p>As I mentioned before I have been working as a Business Analyst for a while but what I really enjoyed the most of that role was the programming part and understanding the needs for the Subject matter experts in order to create a better process for them to become more efficient and accurate and if you look at what a software developer do the first bullet point says that they typically analyse the users’ needs and then design, test and develop a software to meet those needs. If anyone wants to become a software developer they would need at least a bachelor’s degree in computer science, software engineering or a related field.</p>

<p>Here’s some important qualities that a software developer must have:</p>
<p>•	Analytical skills: Developers must analyse users’ needs and then design software to meet those needs.</p>
<p>•	Communication skills: Developers must be able to give clear instructions to others specially when working on a project. They must also explain to their customers how the software works and answer any questions that may have.</p>
<p>•	Creativity: Developers are the creative minds behind new computer software so this is an important skill as well.</p>
<p>•	Detail oriented: Developers often work on many parts of an application or system at the same time and must therefore be able to concentrate and pay attention to detail.</p>
<p>•	Interpersonal skills: Software developers must be able to work well with others who contribute to designing, developing, and programming successful software.</p>
<p>•	Problem-solving skills: Because developers are in charge of software from beginning to end, they must be able to solve problems that arise throughout the design process.</p>

<p> Currently, I haven’t set my eyes on a specific role but I’m constantly looking for any opportunities to use apply the new skills I have and I will acquire.</p>
